Stelligent is a technology services company that provides DevOps Automation in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. We aim for “one-click deployment.” Our raison d’être is to help our customers gain the ability to continuously deploy their software, when they want to, and with confidence.

We’ve been providing Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery solutions in AWS since 2009.

A typical Stelligent engagement includes automating the infrastructure and implementing deployment pipelines that underpin our customers’ applications.

A typical Stelligent engineer is experienced and skilled in software development and systems operations, is a certified AWS solutions architect, and readily joins in our customers’ teams. Firm believers in the DevOps culture, our engineers collaborate directly as team members (i.e., participate in team stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, etc.) and treat all work products as part of the same asset base (i.e., tested, versioned, documented, etc.).

Stelligent is driven by a culture of constant improvement and a desire for automation. Stelligent (now HOSTING) CTO Paul Duvall has been a driving force in the advancement of “continuous *” practices, with such works as the Jolt Award-winning Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk, and the video series, DevOps in AWS, both published by Addison-Wesley Professional.
